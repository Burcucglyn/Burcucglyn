👋 Hi, I’m @Burcucglyn

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a dedicated professional with a passion for data analysis and programming. 
With a background in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Tableau and QlikView, 
I am committed to continuous learning and staying abreast of the latest developments in the tech world.

👀 I’m interested in the fields of data analysis, database management, and social media analytics. My focus areas include MySQL database and Python programming, 
Pandas for data manipulation, and creating insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

🌱 Currently, I am expanding my skills in data science and business analysis and visualisation tools such as Tableau.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to data analysis, Python programming, and database management. 
Whether it's working on spreadsheet analysis, database projects, or contributing to data-driven decision-making, 
I am enthusiastic about collaborating on meaningful and impactful work.


🏊‍♀️🏃‍♀️Outside of work, you can find me either running around or swimming in the lido. 
Currently, training for a half marathon, getting ready for summer spending the right amount of time at the gym. 
📚My new obsession reading about dream analysis, and collective unconsciousness.

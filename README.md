# Hi, I'm Burdzhu!

Environmental engineer turned data scientist. I enjoy the part most people skip: cleaning the mess, finding structure, building pipelines that don't break. Numbers are easy. Reading them honestly, accounting for bias, spotting what others miss: that's the real work. My engineering background means I solve problems and build things that work reliably, not just in a notebook.

## Featured Work

**[london-air-quality-prediction](https://github.com/Burcucglyn/london-air-quality-prediction)** MSc dissertation. Trained 556 models (Random Forest and CNN) across London's air quality monitoring networks: LAQN (78 stations, 6 regulatory pollutants) and DEFRA (18 stations, 37 pollutants). Compared both networks against shared regulatory pollutants, with an extended comparison across DEFRA's full pollutant set. Built a cleaning pipeline that reduced LAQN metadata issues from 47.5% to 17.2%. The key finding from the Random Forest models: t-1 lag features explain 85-95% of prediction variance. Hourly air quality prediction is fundamentally a persistence problem, and data quality (DEFRA, 91.2% complete) consistently beat data quantity (LAQN, 141 site-pollutant combinations). `Python` `scikit-learn` `TensorFlow` `Pandas`

**[audiopulse-pipeline](https://github.com/Burcucglyn/audiopulse-pipeline)** Data engineering pipeline for YouTube audio collection and engagement analysis. Built serial, parallel, and rate-limited download modes with thread-safe logging. Parallel mode ran 5x faster. Ran identical queries in both Pandas and PySpark to compare behaviour on the same dataset. `Python` `PySpark` `Multiprocessing` `yt-dlp`

**[piazza-api](https://github.com/Burcucglyn/piazza-api)** RESTful social platform with JWT auth, post expiration logic, and interaction tracking. Deployed three ways: VM with PM2, Docker with docker-compose, and Kubernetes on GKE (5 replicas, load balancer). 20 automated tests, 100% pass rate. `Node.js` `Express` `MongoDB` `Docker` `Kubernetes` `GCP`

**[speech-classifier-nlp](https://github.com/Burcucglyn/speech-classifier-nlp)** Two NLP projects: syntactic analysis of 19th-century novels using dependency parsing and PMI, and a political speech classifier trained on 40,000 UK parliamentary speeches. SVM with TF-IDF outperformed the SMOTE pipeline a valid finding about when simpler wins. `Python` `spaCy` `NLTK` `scikit-learn`

## Get in Touch

What I want to do next is build prediction systems that work reliably and translate complex data into something any audience can act on. Background in environmental engineering, three years in marketing that taught me how to communicate results beyond technical teams, and an MSc in Data Science. The sector matters less to me than the problem.
